        <h4>Project Objective</h4>

        <p>For this project I was required to design the brand identity & packaging for Orengi, a company that produces organic cold-pressed juices. The creative brief specified that the logo had to be fun, playful and use bright colours without looking aritificial.

        <h4>Concept</h4>

        <p>Due to the nature of the company's name, my first concept for a logo was a modified orange. After designing over 20 different oranges and trying different compositions, I chose a minimalist logo that was easy to recognize and relate to the company's activities. </p>

        <h4> Outcome</h4>

        <p>The biggest challenge during the development of this project was finding a font that conveyed the same feeling as the logo, after some trial and error I was able to find a fitting choice that didn't overpower the logo. The result is a simple, yet effective logo that can be used in different media. In addition to the original logo, some horizontal versions were created as well.</p>
